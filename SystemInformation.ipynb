        "   - **Position Independent**: The supplier is usually at the start, but if mentioned later, prioritize the entity actually performing the scope of work.\n",
        "   - **Taxonomy Alignment**: Output the **Clean Brand Name** (e.g., \"The Boeing Co., St. Louis\" -> \"Boeing\").\n",
        "     - Your goal is to output a name that matches a standard defence taxonomy.\n",

        "   - **Services/RDT&E/IT:** Use \"Not Applicable\".\n",
